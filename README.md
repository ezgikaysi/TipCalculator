Tip Calculator
==================

This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the pre-assignment requirement for Codepath.

Time spent: 8 hours

Completed user stories:

* [x] Required: Basic tip calculator functionality

Notes: 

This only works for iPhone Retina 4" in Portrait orientation. I did not spend any time making the app look right in other screen sizes and Landscape orientation.
